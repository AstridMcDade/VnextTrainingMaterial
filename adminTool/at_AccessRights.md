# Access Rights

**Access Rights** define the permissions and privileges granted to users or participants within the system, ensuring secure and controlled access to resources. By specifying what actions users can perform, such as viewing, editing, or deleting data, and limiting their access to the necessary functions, access rights help protect sensitive information, maintain system integrity, and promote accountability.

- **Secure and Controlled Access**: Permissions are tailored to participantsâ€™ roles and responsibilities, ensuring that users can only access resources relevant to their tasks.

- **Data Protection**: Sensitive information is safeguarded by restricting access based on organisational needs and user responsibilities.

- **System Integrity**: Controlled access minimises risks of unauthorised actions, preserving the system's stability and functionality.

- **Accountability**: Clearly defined access rights promote responsibility by associating actions with authorised participants.

## Participant Access Levels

Participant access levels define the scope of permissions and responsibilities assigned to different roles within the system:

- ### Company Administrators

    Have full control over the entire system, including all settings and configurations.

- ### Administrators

    Manage specific areas of the system based on their assigned responsibilities.

- ### Designers

    Focus on creating templates and generating reports to support organisational needs.

- ### Developers

    Customise system functionality, including scripting and extending features.
