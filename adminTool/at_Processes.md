# Processes

The Processes menu provides tools for managing and overseeing system processes, including activation and runtime operations.

- **Activation** : Administrators can manage process versions by marking them as active or inactive, allowing control over which version of a process is in use at any given time.

- **Runtime** : Administrators can perform runtime operations, such as reassigning tasks between users or cancelling processes when necessary to maintain workflow efficiency and address any issues promptly.
