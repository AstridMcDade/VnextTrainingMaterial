A File Control is a user interface element that facilitates the selection, uploading, and management of files within an application. It enables users to attach, view, and remove documents while offering configurable settings for display, storage location, validation, and interaction. This control ensures seamless file handling while maintaining system constraints such as file size limits and required fields.
