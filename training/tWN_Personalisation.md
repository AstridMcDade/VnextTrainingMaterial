In this video we explore the personalisation wizard.

## Personalisation Wizard in the Processware Web Navigator

The Processware Web Navigator Includes a Personalisation Wizard. When logging on for the first time, the Wizard guides you through seven steps to set up a customized experience just for you. The easy-to-use Wizard walks you step-by-step through selecting and organising the widgets and view, ensuring that every log-on reflects your preferred layout.

### Steps in the Personalisation Wizard

1. **Profile**: Upload a work-appropriate profile picture or avatar.

2. **Appearance**: Where you can set your preferred user interface appearance: light or dark mode.

3. **Layout**: Select your preferred task layout:

4. **Focused**: Hides metadata for a streamlined view.

5. **Informational**: Displays metadata for additional context.

6. **Landing**: Select a landing page as the default Log On screen.

7. **Menu**: Select a menu location: either on the top of, or on the left of the page.

8. **Tasks**: Set the Pending Task page parameters.

9. **Done**: This is the final step in completing the Personalisation.
