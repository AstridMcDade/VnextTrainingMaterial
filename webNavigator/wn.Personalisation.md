## Personalisation Wizard in the Processware Web Navigator

The Web Navigator includes a Personalisation Wizard that allows users to customise their interface for a tailored experience. During the first login, this wizard guides users through seven steps to set up their preferences, ensuring an optimised and personalised layout for subsequent sessions.

### Steps in the Personalisation Wizard

1. **Profile**: Upload a work-appropriate profile picture or avatar.

2. **Appearance**: Choose between light or dark mode for the interface.

3. **Layout**: Select your preferred task layout:

4. **Focused**: Hides metadata for a streamlined view.

5. **Informational**: Displays metadata for additional context.

6. **Landing**: Set the default screen displayed upon login.

7. **Menu**: Choose the menu location (top of the page or left side).

8. **Tasks**: Configure parameters for the pending tasks page.

9. **Done**: Finalise and save your settings.
