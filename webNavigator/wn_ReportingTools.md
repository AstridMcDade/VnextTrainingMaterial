# Reporting Tools

The Reports section displays a list of all available reports that the logged-in user is authorised to view.

> [!NOTE]
> When migrating from PW2019 to VNext, legacy reports from the existing Processware instance will remain accessible. These are referred to as *Custom* Reports. When adding reports to a widget, this configuration is managed accordingly.
