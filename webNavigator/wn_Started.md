This menu provides real-time monitoring of the status and progress of each task or process, ensuring transparency and accountability at every stage. It offers detailed insights into the current status of each process, including:

- completed steps and
- pending actions.

This visibility helps users manage responsibilities, identify potential bottlenecks, and take timely action to keep projects on track.

There are three primary methods available for tracking tasks or processes that are still in progress:

1. **Initiator Tracking Rights**: The user who initiated a process retains tracking rights to monitor the process they have started.

2. **Task-Based Tracking**: Users who are required to act on one or more tasks within a process can track the process from the point at which their involvement begins.

3. **Additional Tracking Rights**: Users with additional tracking rights, as defined in the Tracking Rights property of the participant setup, can track the process at any time, even if they are not directly involved. This is typically granted to supervisory or managerial users.

These tracking methods ensure that all relevant parties can stay informed and take appropriate actions as needed to ensure the smooth progression of tasks and processes.
